# Thesis

This repo contains all the programs and the LaTeX files used for my thesis on quantum annealing. 

The directory [`D-Wave`](D-Wave) contains the program written in Python using the Ocean SDK, which is the one D-Wave quantum annealers use: in particular there are some files which simulate a complete graph and others which use a particular manual embedding. The results of the annealing are summed in [`Results D-Wave.txt`](D-Wave/Results20%D-Wave.txt).

In the directory [`TRY`](TRY) there are all the program I used to try and test the function I later used in the other programs for my thesis.
